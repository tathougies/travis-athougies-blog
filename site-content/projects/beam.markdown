Beam is a Haskell interface to relational databases. Its key strengths are its type-safety and
intuitive syntax. Beam is written in a pure Haskell, and doesn't make use of Template Haskell or
non-intuitive embedded domain specific languages. Instead it makes extensive use of Generics, Closed
Type Families, and other elements of Haskell's strong type system. Unlike other popular Haskell
database interfaces, Beam tries to work with the compiler rather than in spite of it.
