Seven weeks ago, I did a [post on my new NFT hydroponics system](post:2014-08-11-new-nft-hydroponics-system). A few days afterwards, I transplanted some pea seedlings into the system. This post catalogs these peas journey from seedlings to fruiting.

![Covering the plants led to a quick recovery. By the next morning, they were looking alive again](image:hydroponics/peas-coming-back-1.jpg)
![The next afternoon, they were looking almost as good as new, except for some visible leaf damage from the sun](image:hydroponics/peas-fully-back.jpg)
