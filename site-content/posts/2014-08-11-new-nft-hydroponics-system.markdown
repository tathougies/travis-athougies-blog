This is my promised blog post on my new, portable hydroponics system. This is an NFT system
contained entirely in one bucket. I haven't planted anything in it yet (still waiting for my mother
tomato plants to grow so I can start some cuttings), but everything is now ready for transplants.

What is NFT?
-----------

NFT stands for Nutrient Film Technique, and it's one of the most deployed hydroponics systems. NFT
is a hydroponic technique that doesn't require the use of growth medium, like soil, clay pebbles, or
perlite. Instead, plant roots are grown directly in a thin (think a few millimeter thick) film of
water. This film is generated when a pump moves water from a nutrient reservoir into the grow
bed. The water is pumped at a slow enough rate so that it drains out via gravity before the root
zone ever fills up.

So why is NFT so widely used? Basically, NFT gives plant roots exactly what they want. Everyone
knows that plant roots need water, but plant roots also need equal amounts of oxygen! In most water
culture hydroponic systems where roots are directly exposed to water, oxygen must be supplied in
some form, whether through aquarium bubblers, repeated flooding and draining of the growing
area, or a small trickle of water. All of these solutions have their drawbacks. In particular, using
aquarium airstones to oxygenate water _requires_ the use of an air pump, and if that component
fails, root death will occur relatively rapidly. Repeat flooding and draining is also subject to
failure if either the pump or the timers stop working. Finally, drip-based solutions are subject to
pump failure and drip line clogging as salts build up. Unlike all these systems, NFT has only one
source of failure -- the pump. As long as the pump is working and has enough electricity, the system
will function in some form.

There are some drawbacks to NFT though, and they all basically boil down to issues with the root
mat. Plant root systems do _really_ well in NFT, and so on, plant roots cover the entire root zone
area where the nutrient film used to be. This can result in puddling -- areas of nutrient solution
that aren't drained via gravity and become stagnant. This leads to root death in those areas,
because the solution suffocates the roots there. I'm hoping that because my system is so small, the
pump action will manage to agitate all these puddles, thus mitigating this issue.

My system
----------

Okay that's enough of the theory, let's talk about my system!

My system is a minified NFT system consisting of just one 5-gallon bucket and cover, a 12 inch
diameter grow tray, a pump, an air pump, an air stone, 5 net pots and some vinyl tubes and
joints. The grow tray is suspended over the bucket (it fits snuggly on the top of the bucket). The
pump delivers nutrient solution from the bottom of the tank to the grow tray, where the water is
drained back to the reservoir through holes drilled into its bottom. Water level is maintained at a
few millimeters -- perfect for plant roots.

The bucket cover goes over the grow tray and has five holes in it where the net pots are hung. The
net pots are hung so that the water level in the grow tray barely touches their bottom, ensuring
good oxygenation for plant roots.

The air pump is attached to an air stone in the nutrient solution. The pump works continuously to
oxygenate the solution, thus providing another vector of oxygen delivery to plant roots.

Since I had a white bucket, I had to make an opaque wrapping for it, so that no light gets
through. Light getting into the nutrient reservoir is bad, because it leads to perfect conditions
for algal growth. For this covering, I used some white-on-black plastic fabric I got at the fabric
store. I put the white side on the outside to reflect the sunlight, so the nutrient solution remains
cool. The black side went on the inside and kept all the light out.

![I bought a 12-inch diameter grow tray for the plant roots. The tray is suspended at the top of the bucket and has holes drilled into it so that the nutrient solution drains from the root zone. I added a plastic netting to the bottom so that plant roots would be discouraged from going through these holes and blocking drainage, but I expect that will probably happen anyway. My contingency plan is to drain a large drainage hole in the side of the tray to maintain water level.](image:nft-system/root-zone.jpg)
![The net pots go in the bucket cover, which had five holes cut into it. The cover went over the grow tray. Finally, I put 5 2-inch neoprene collars inside each pot (not pictured). These collars will provide support for my plant stems as the plants mature. Also, the collars will keep any stray sunlight from reaching the plant roots.](image:nft-system/sites.jpg)
![I put a plastic cover from Home Depot on top of the entire system. This is mainly to preserve moisture for my new seedlings and cuttings which I will put into the system. Without the cover, these could possibly dry out.](image:nft-system/with-cover.jpg)
