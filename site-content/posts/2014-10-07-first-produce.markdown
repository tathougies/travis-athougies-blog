It's been a real adventure, filled with scorching sunlight and fungal scares, but my hydroponic peas have finally started producing pods. Today, I sampled the first fully grown pod from the plant. After a light wash, Ileane and I each had half the pod. The pea was the perfect snap pea: _very_ sweet, crisp, and -- most importantly -- grown completely soil free!
