Physicists and laymen alike have pounded their heads in frustration
over the phenomenon of quantum entanglement. Einstein himself famously
derided the entire concept as 'spooky action at a distance'. Yet, the
experimental data clearly indicate that the phenomenon exists in our
universe.

For those who don't know, quantum entanglement refers to the result of the following two postulates of quantum mechanics.

1. Particles truly do not have values for certain observables until these observables are measured.

2. Certain values of observables are conserved (the sum total never changes).



phenomenon where knowing the state of one particle determines the
state of another. That in and of itself is not surprising. However,
this occurs even if the particles are separated in space by thousands
of light years. Moreover,
