When I was in kindergarten, my class took a trip to a local farm.

For most of my class (myself included), this was the first time we had ever been on a farm. The
teachers and parents could have mistaken us for the animals &mdash; that's how rowdy we were.

Up until then, the only farms we had seen were in picture books, where the farmers, animals, and
plants usually all had big eyes and smiling faces. As a young kid, we were taught that farms are
positive places, where animals, plants, and farmers all work together to grow our food. After all,
you can see their wide tooth-filled grins in picture books.

As we grow up and things acquire more of an eye for shades of grey, we begin to see that agriculture
is not the smile-filled world of youth, but something which has both advantages and disadvantages.

[Having attended New Food Revolution last week](post:2014-11-05-the-future-of-food), I've spent the
past week thinking a lot about the disadvantages, such as environmental pollution, water scarcity,
and land use, and about how hydroponic growing techniques could mitigate them. Although I don't
think that hydroponic and vertical farming could ever totally replace our need for soil, I think
that shifting as much of our food production as possible to hydroponics could have its advantages.

Nitrate runoff
---------------

Nitrogen is the most important nutrient for plants, and while it’s abundant on Earth (70% of our
atmosphere is Nitrogen gas), plants can only absorb it in the form of nitrates. Farmers use
fertilizers to provide plants nitrogen in this form, but dissolved nitrates that are put into the
ground eventually find their way back to the groundwater, which is used for drinking
water. Unfortunately, you can’t drink this water (to explain why, consider that your urine is mostly
nitrates dissolved in water).

Hydroponic growing addresses this problem in two ways. Firstly, by the time they're ready for
disposal, hydroponic nutrients have been feeding plants for at least two weeks, meaning they're
simply
[weaker than normal fertilizer.](http://www.generalhydroponics.com/blog/2011/08/15/put-your-hydroponic-waste-water-to-good-use/)
Secondly, since hydroponics is a recirculating system, waste water never inadvertently finds its way
into the environment. Disposal is a carefully controlled process where the grower drains the
nutrient tank into a waste water tank and then has the chance to treat the water. Treating the water
can be as simple as using the nutrient solution to
[grow weeds or low-nutrient requiring plants.](http://scienceinhydroponics.com/2009/02/hydroponic-nutrient-solution-toxicity.html)

Nutrient solution is also the perfect growing environment for algae. With a small air stone and some
space, it would be possible to use the waste water to grow algae. As the algae grew, they would use
the nutrients in the water, slowly purifying the water. The algae could then be harvested to produce
[biofuel,](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algae_fuel) or other algal products. The diagram below
depicts such a hypothetical "algae farm".

The algae would filter the water as they absorbed the dissolved solids. After sterilization, the water could be re-used. The algae could be harvested to
create biofuel.<br/>

Water Usage
------------

Agriculture is currently the single largest consumer of fresh water in the world. Since fresh water
is always in limited supply, any water used for agriculture is water that we aren’t able to drink or
store. Big farms consume so much water that they can run groundwater wells dry, meaning that when
drought inevitably strikes, its effects are heightened. The effects here aren’t only environmental;
groundwater depletion has economic effects as well. According to California Secretary of Agriculture
Karen Ross, the current drought in California has affected over 17,000 jobs.

Hydroponics solves this issue by using up to 90% less water than traditional agriculture. This
phenomenon has nothing to do with hydroponics; it’s a common savings in a recirculating agricultural
system. By continuously re-using the same water, these systems eliminate the need for a constant
supply of fresh water to be pumped out of the ground. This is good economically too. Water is one of
the largest inputs to an agricultural operation, so optimizing the amount of crop produced per
gallon is essential to controlling costs.

Proliferation of Pests
-----------------------

![~~FLOWED~~ *Fusarium wilt* is an incurable plant disease caused by the *Fusarium* fungus. Once introduced into a patch of soil, the virus quickly spreads and produces spores that can reside in the soil up to 20 years, rendering the land unusable](image:disadvantages/fusarium-wilt.jpg)

Pests are currently a large and growing problem for traditional soil-based growers. Worms, beetles,
and other insects that prey on plants thrive in traditional farms. Bacterial, viral, and fungal
diseases continually evolve to infect even disease-resistant strains of crops. According to the EPA,
American farmers used almost [**877 million pounds**](http://www.ers.usda.gov/topics/farm-practices-management/chemical-inputs/pesticide-use-markets.aspx)
of pesticides in 2007. The US has about [408 million acres](http://www.epa.gov/oecaagct/ag101/landuse.html)
of farmland, so that's about 2 pounds an acre. These pesticides later run off into our rivers and
groundwater, making them unusable for drinking.

Because hydroponics uses no soil or even media in some cases, pests that live out their lifecyle in
the soil are simply eliminated. Although hydroponic crops are still susceptible to bacterial, viral,
and fungal diseases, growers can limit the ability of these organisms to infect plants by
sterilizing the nutrient solution, using either UV or hydrogen peroxide.  Once again, the economic
benefits are clear: hydroponic growers do not need to be as afraid of catastrophic crop failure due
to invasive pests.

Disadvantages
--------------

However, hydroponics doesn't have all the answers -- yet. You may have noticed that I did not
include greenhouse gas emissions on this list. That's becuase it’s not immediately clear if current
hydroponic growing techniques really net out to zero greenhouse gas emissions. Sure, many people
have However, hydroponics allow us to achieve a degree of control over plant nutrition and
metabolism unattainable in soil-based systems, so scientific advances may lead to true carbon
neutrality.
