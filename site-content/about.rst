Hi! I’m Travis. By education, I’m a mathematician and computer scientist, but I
like to do a bit of everything. I’m currently a software engineer at
`Formation`_. This blog documents my thoughts on whatever topic I’m currently
interested in. Usually, this is one of programming, hydroponics, woodworking, or
something else I care about.
