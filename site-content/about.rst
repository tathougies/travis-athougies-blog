Hi! I’m Travis. By education, I’m a mathematician and computer scientist, but really, I do a bit of everything. I’m currently a strategy consultant at Bain and Company. This blog documents my thoughts on whatever topic I’m currently interested in. Usually, this is one of programming, startups, and –- most recently -– hydroponics and agriculture.
