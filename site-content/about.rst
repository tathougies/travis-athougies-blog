Hi! I’m Travis. By education, I’m a mathematician and computer
scientist, but I like to do a bit of everything. I’m currently a
Senior Performance Architect at NVIDIA working on building compilers
for GPUs. This blog documents my thoughts on whatever topic I’m
currently interested in. Usually, this is one of programming,
hydroponics, woodworking, mathematics, philosophy
