<div id="post">
<p>In the previous <a href="../posts/2024-06-12-to-infinity-and-beyond.html">post</a>, we talked about the various ‘levels’ of infinity and how
they come about through relatively simple ideas.</p>
<p>Now, I want to take about a different kind of infinity, that we briefly touched upon in the last article.</p>
<p>In the last article, we talked about how we can have infinitely long sequences of rational numbers that had no rational
‘limit’. For example, there is a infinitely long sequence of fractions that get ever closer to a number that, when
multiplied by itself, will yield 2, but no fraction in this sequence, when multiplied by itself will ever be 2. We
invented the real numbers to give names to these various ‘unreachable’ numbers.</p>
<p>For a long time, mathematicians believed that all these numbers could be described by algebraic equations with various
powers. For example, they thought that every real number was the solution to some quadratic, cubic, quartic,
etc. quations. For example, <span class="math inline">\(\sqrt{2}\)</span> is the solution to the equation <span class="math inline">\(x^2 - 2 = 0\)</span>. The polynomial <span class="math inline">\(x^3 - 8x^2 + x - 1
= 0\)</span> has other solutions that are irrational, but can be described as solutions to that polynomial equation.</p>
<p>Indeed, infinitely many reals are described this way. These are called the <em>algebraic</em> numbers.</p>
<p>But there are <em>way</em> more reals than that. Leibniz was the first to conjecture the existence of what we call the
<em>transcendental</em> numbers, when he proved that <span class="math inline">\(\sin{x}\)</span> was not the solution of any polynomial. In fact, most
interesting reals are not algebraic. For example, both <span class="math inline">\(\pi\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(e\)</span> are transcendental. That is, there is no polynomial
with rational coefficients whose solution is <span class="math inline">\(\pi\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(e\)</span>.</p>
<p>Interestingly enough, when it comes to countability, the algebraic numbers are countable (polynomial equations
are). That means the uncountability of the reals comes from the transcendental numbers.</p>
<p>As an aside, here are some particularly weird numbers:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Chaitlin’s Constant</strong> (<span class="math inline">\(\Omega\)</span>) – A real number that is the chance a randomly generated Turing machine will
halt. This is actually a computable number, despite haltingness being impossible.</li>
<li><strong>Champernowne Constant</strong> – This is the number <span class="math inline">\(0.123456789101112\ldots\)</span> (i.e., concatenate all the digits of the
natural numbers). This is not a rational number, but is certainly real (you can construct a sequence of rationals that
get ever closer to it, just take the numbers <span class="math inline">\(0.1\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(0.12\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(0.123\)</span>, etc.). There are infinitely many of these in all
natural bases.</li>
<li><strong>Euler-Mascharoni Constant</strong> – Divergence between the harmonic series (<span class="math inline">\(\frac{1}{1}\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\frac{1}{2}\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\frac{1}{3}\)</span>,
…) and the natural logarithm.</li>
</ul>
<p>So, if we can’t write polynomials to describe these numbers and there are uncountably infinitely many of them, how can
we describe them in a meaningful way?</p>
<p>One way to do this is to write a program that generates the rational sequence of numbers that eventually converges to
them. The easiest way to do this is to write a program that computes the digits of the decimal expansion. Note that not
all real numbers can be described this way (we’ll get to this later). In fact, since there’s a countable number of
programs <a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>, there’s a countable number of these reals.</p>
<p>With this in mind, we can define a function <span class="math inline">\(K(x)\)</span> that maps each computable real to the length of the <em>shortest</em>
program that generates its digits <a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a>. That is,</p>
<p>\[K(x) = {|p| , : , T(p) = x},\]</p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(|p|\)</span> is the length of the program and <span class="math inline">\(T(p)\)</span> is the output of the program when run. In mathematics, this concept
is called <em>Kolmogorov complexity</em>.</p>
<p>Either way, it is clear that every computable real has a shortest program, given some language.</p>
<p>Note that the computable reals contain both transcendental numbers and <em>all</em> the algebraic numbers. Thus, they are
‘larger’ than the algebraic numbers. However, the computable reals are also countable. Thus, we have that the
uncountability of the reals comes from the <em>non-computable</em> reals.</p>
<h1 id="a-random-aside">A random aside</h1>
<p>We now interrupt this fascinating treatise on the real numbers for a random discussion on <em>randomness</em>.</p>
<p>Let’s consider a sequence of numbers:</p>
<p>\[{1, 192, 3281, 3, 112, }\].</p>
<p>Is this sequence random?</p>
<p>Oof… a loaded question. In order to answer it, you would have to know what comes next. But knowing that <span class="math inline">\(8192\)</span> comes
next wouldn’t actually help you to determine if the sequence is random any more than knowing just the first five terms.</p>
<p>No, in order to say whether the sequence is random, we must instead think about it holistically. We say a sequence is
<em>random</em> if we cannot predict the next number. When something is predictable, then it’s not random. To be random means
to have an uninspectable interiority that cannot be predicted.</p>
<p>So now we go back to what it means to be predictable. If something is predictable, then I can describe to you how to
predict it. In other words, I can … <em>write a program</em>!</p>
<p>So now, going back to the sequence above. While I can’t say whether it’s random looking at only five terms, I can
conjecture that, if you give me every term and I successfully write a program to predict every one, then the sequence is
<em>not</em> random. Of course, in real life, we cannot get every term and determine if your program predicts them all
correctly. To deal with this ambiguity we invented science and decided that, if we repeat enough times, then it probably
works. This attitude is the main separation between scientists and mathematicians <a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a>.</p>
<h1 id="a-step-back-to-reality">A step back to reality</h1>
<p>Now we have two disparate concepts both concerning computer programs. On one hand we have random sequences of numbers,
which are sequences that cannot be described using computer programs. On the other hand, we have the computable reals
which are numbers that can be described by computer programs giving their digits to an arbitrary degree.</p>
<p>What does this say about all the <em>non-computable</em> reals? Well, if we take each digit in the exapansion of a
non-computable real and put it in a sequence, then what do we know about that sequence?</p>
<p>We know that there is no program that can successfully calculate the next number 100% percent of the time. If we had
this program, then the number would be computable.</p>
<p>Thus, the digits of the non-computable reals are <em>random</em>! There is no way to distinguish their expansions from random
sequences. And yet, they certainly exist as the limit of rational numbers.</p>
<h1 id="turing-machines-and-infinity">Turing Machines and infinity</h1>
<p>When I said above that by program, I meant any description of a deterministic process, I think it’s important to say
what that means. Deterministic does not mean finite. A Turing machine (which is one universal model for computation) is
explicitly <em>infinite</em>. That is, their tape is infinite. In reality, no real computer is infinite. Computers are limited
by the number of bits in their RAM. This means, any real computer is limited in that it can only simulate <em>finite</em>
Turing machines. This means that there are infinitely many computable reals that cannot be described by even the largest
modern computer (because there are reals whose Kolmogorov complexity is larger than the size of the memory of the
largest computer).</p>
<p>Let’s examine one consequence of this with regard to AI models. GPT3 has 1.5 billion parameters. It’s parameters are
32-bit floating point numbers, so let’s say that it is characterized by 48 billion bits. A bit can be thought of as a
yes/no question. There are <span class="math inline">\(2^{48,000,000,000}\)</span> billion possibilities for the parameters of GPT3, and OpenAI, through
the use of massive GPUs managed to come across one of those combinations that seems to encode general intelligence.</p>
<p>But there’s a problem with this narrative. There’s a limit to how much computation any computer can do. In GPT world,
this is called the ‘context length’ and there’s a limit. Current SoTA LLMs have context lengths in the millions (i.e.,
they can analyze and respond to a conversation with approximately 1 million words). To go beyond this, you have to
compress history to fit on the computer. Of course, there are only so many bits you have to do this.</p>
<p>Suppose you have <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> bits of space to compress the history of the conversation, and you’ve said <span class="math inline">\(2^N + 1 million\)</span>
words. Now what? Well, to generate the next token, you take into account the previous 1 million words and the
history. You then produce a new token and a new set of bits for history. However, you’ve now generated <span class="math inline">\(2^N + 1\)</span> total
history values. By the Pigeonhole principle, the history value must be the same as a previous one. What happens now? At
this point, since LLMs are deterministic (result of a computer program), it must start producing identical results.</p>
<p>To emphasize: any deterministic computer program that runs with a finite state will eventually produce the same output
given the same input.</p>
<p>In other words, eventually, even the best LLM running on physical hardware <em>must repeat itself</em>.</p>
<h1 id="humans">Humans</h1>
<p>Now the 1 billion dollar question: do humans suffer this same limitation? There are two thoughts.</p>
<p>The first thought is that our brains are physical and thus encode a certain possibly number of states (physicists call
this entropy).</p>
<p>The second is that we are something more and thus unencodable in any number of states.</p>
<p>If the first thought is correct, then the human brain is simulatable on a computer of proper size. If the second, then
the brain is harnessing some esoteric aspect of physics to achieve what it does. Computers cannot do this, thus cannot
simulate the brain (and thus consciousness).</p>
<p>Or put another way, either the brain is computing something computable, or it is computing something uncomputable. If
it’s uncomputable, then it’s random (in the sense described above), and this <em>something more</em>, which we call
consciousness, is intrinsically tied to randomness (because if it weren’t, then it would be predictable, and
inspectable, and interiority is a characteristic of consciousness).</p>

considered the norm. It’s surprising we can predict anything frankly.<a href="#fnref3" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
