<div id="post">
<p>In the previous <a href="../posts/2024-06-12-to-infinity-and-beyond.html">post</a>, we talked about the various ‘levels’ of infinity and how
they come about through relatively simple ideas.</p>
<p>To recap, we went over the natural numbers as the first example of an infinite of things.</p>
<p>We then considered how to make addition and multiplication nice when dealing with equations of the form <span class="math inline">\(x + y = z\)</span> or
<span class="math inline">\(x \times y = z\)</span>. That is we wanted to be able to solve for any one of <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span>, or <span class="math inline">\(z\)</span> given the other two. We added
the <em>negative</em> numbers and <em>reciprocals</em> to make this possible.</p>
<p>But, then we decided to look at equations of the form <span class="math inline">\(x + x = y\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(x \times x = y\)</span>. We find that for <span class="math inline">\(x + x = y\)</span>, we
can solve for <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> given <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> by just doing <span class="math inline">\(x = \frac{y}{2}\)</span>. However, for <span class="math inline">\(x \times x = y\)</span>, we found that there are
choices for <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> that make the equation impossible to solve unless we add yet <em>more</em> numbers. But these numbers were
fundamentally different, and we found that there are a lot more of these numbers then there are of the normal counting
numbers, despite both sets being infinite.</p>
<p>In this post, I want to consider how it is I was able to describe these numbers which transcend infinity in a blog. That
is – how are we able to describe infinite things, even things more infinite than the numbers – in a finite space.</p>
<p>To start with I want to observe the following. Consider <span class="math inline">\(\frac{1}{3}\)</span>. Most of us learn in grade school that this is equivalent to</p>
<p>\[0.\overline{3333}…\]</p>
<p>where the <span class="math inline">\(\overline{333}\)</span> indicates that this pattern repeats indefinitely. This is an infinite decimal expansion of
<span class="math inline">\(\frac{1}{3}\)</span>, but it’s only infinite when written as a decimal. There are other representations of <span class="math inline">\(\frac{1}{3}\)</span> that
are not infinite. For example, <span class="math inline">\(\frac{1}{3}\)</span> is a simple finite representation. Alternatively, we can write
<span class="math inline">\(\frac{1}{3}\)</span> in base 3 as <span class="math inline">\(0.1\)</span>. Moreover, the line over the 3s indicating that the go on forever actually uniquely
identifies <span class="math inline">\(\frac{1}{3}\)</span>. No matter what we pick, this is a number that is solidly identified in a finite space.</p>
<p>Either way, just because there are some representations of <span class="math inline">\(\frac{1}{3}\)</span> that require an infinite representation, there
do exist others that do not.</p>
<p>But not all numbers are so nice. The number we looked at in the last post was <span class="math inline">\(\sqrt{2}\)</span>, which is the number that
yields two when multiplied by itself. The decimal expansion of <span class="math inline">\(\sqrt{2}\)</span> looks like</p>
<p>\[1.41415962…\]</p>
<p>Note here that there is no line over any digits. There is no repetition. That is to say that this expansion goes on
forever, but it never ends in a pattern that repeats indefinitely. There might be large swaths of numbers in the
expansion where digits repeat over and over again, but eventually, these will end and some other new sequence will
begin.</p>
<p>Even worse, unlike <span class="math inline">\(\frac{1}{3}\)</span>. We cannot write <span class="math inline">\(\sqrt{2}\)</span> as a fraction, because it’s not rational. But we can give
you ever closer approximations. In the last post, we came up with a general procedure to do this, and get ever closer.</p>
<p>So another way to represent the above is the following:</p>
<p>\[ \{ \frac{3}{2}, \frac{17}{12}, \frac{577}{408}, \ldots \} \]</p>
<p>This is an application of Newton’s method for finding roots (discussed in the last post). We showed that this too will
go on forever.</p>
<p>So what representation can we use for this number? The obvious answer of course is to just use <span class="math inline">\(\sqrt(2)\)</span>. That’s
compact and describes exactly what we want. But what if we want to add <span class="math inline">\(\sqrt(2)\)</span> to itself. In the rational case of
<span class="math inline">\(\frac{1}{3}\)</span>, adding <span class="math inline">\(\frac{1}{3}\)</span> to itself yields a similar finite representation of the repeating decimal:
<span class="math inline">\(\frac{2}{3}\)</span>. But if I add <span class="math inline">\(\sqrt{2}\)</span> to itself, then I just get <span class="math inline">\(2\sqrt{2}\)</span>, which is a finite representation, but not
of the same <em>form</em> as <span class="math inline">\(\sqrt{2}.\)</span> Moreover, if I start adding <span class="math inline">\(\sqrt{3} + \sqrt{2}\)</span>, I can’t reduce them either.</p>
<p>What we want to do now is to come up with some canonical way to describe the real numbers.</p>
<p>In the last post, we saw that the real numbers arose when we tried to find the ‘least’ element of infinite sets of the
rational numbers (or equivalently, the largest). In the case of the fraction sequence for <span class="math inline">\(\sqrt{2}\)</span>, these numbers get
ever closer together, but there is no <em>least</em> value. At least, they had no least value that was rational. But, we just
said that we could name these least values the reals.</p>
<p>So then this is what we’ll use to describe the reals. We’ll say they’re the least values of any set of the rational
numbers.</p>
<p>Sets that are finite have an obvious representation: we just write out all the values.</p>
<p>Sets that are infinite do not have an obvious representation. We need some way to write out infinite sets, but we can’t
do that in general. Can we?</p>
<p>We have to ask what it means to be an infinite collection of things. How would we even talk about this? Ony way is to
suppose I had a magic elf that just tells me, given some number, wheter it’s in that set. Then, to represent this set
finitely, I’d just point to the elf as my finite representative.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, we have no magic elves. Just our five senses and our minds.</p>
<p>What we need really is a way to describe this elf’s behavior. In other words, if I can describe what the elf would do in
every situation, then I would have a way to represent my real number.</p>
<p>One thing about sets is that if an element is in a set, then it always is. That is, the elf will always give the same
answer given the same input. This means that the elf is following a deterministic process to answer my question. [Alan
Turing] tells us that anything following such a deterministic process can (theoretically) be described as a computer
program. In other words, as long as the elf is being deterministic, we theoretically ought to be able to write a finite
computer program that will return the same answers.</p>
<p>So, then this is our way, in general of determining whether a rational is in a set. I will simply give you a <em>program</em>
that determines if it is. This program can be written in Python, C++, or a blog post. It doesn’t matter. If there’s a
deterministic set of rules by which we can say a number is in the set, then I can describe those rules using any syntax
in any language – natural or contrived.</p>
<p>So, for example, for the square root of two above, I can describe to you how I came up with those fractions (it’s
described in my previous post), and now you have a description of a set with the proprties we wanted. Given a rational
number, you can tell me if it’s part of the sequence of numbers or not. You can either do the math by hand, or write an
automated program that does it for you (or come up with a design in the Game of Life, or something else).</p>
<p>But there’s a problem… do you see it?</p>
<p>Whatever I describe to you is made of words. Words are made of letters. There are 26 letters.</p>
<p>If you consider the set of all possible things I could say to you, it’s infinite, but it’s also countable, which means
it’s smaller than the size of the real numbers.</p>
<p>Thus, we are forced to conclude that <em>any</em> finite representation of the real numbers will be unable to describe every
possible real number. There is no way a countable number of things can describe every subset of the rational numbers,
which is what a real number is.</p>
<p>Take a minute to ponder what we’ve done here. We started with strings of <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span>s and <span class="math inline">\(Z\)</span>s, and we’ve slowly extended it to
a system that defies <em>any</em> finite explanation. In fact, some real numbers are so complicated that the only way to
‘write’ them is to write the digits down. These digits may be infinite, and there’s no deterministic way of saying which
digit comes next. How can you write such a thing?</p>
<h2 id="a-note-on-description">A note on description</h2>
<p>Above, I purposefully avoided using the word ‘compute.’ Given the ubiquity of computers today, this word is loaded
because it biases us to thinking of silicon-based machines. These are a kind of computer, sure, but computing is a much
more broad idea. Turing showed that any number that can be described systematically by a human is equivalent to any number
that can be calculated via his Turing machines. This makes quite a few systems Turing complete, meaning they’re able to
calculate any of these numbers. These systems are automated – i.e., require no human intervention, and are
deterministic in their operation. Examples include turing machines of course, but also the lambda calculus, the game of
life, and even simpler systems, like Rule 110, which encodes in one number all rules required to compute any number that
we can.</p>
<p>To quickly handle an objection, one can claim that they can describe a number that Turing machines cannot compute by
defining a number equivalent to whether or not a program halts. For example, let</p>
<p>\[N = \prod{n = 0}_{\infty} P(n) \]</p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(P(n)\)</span> is the probability that a Python program of length <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> halts. This number is seemingly definable and
describable by humans, but not Turing machines.</p>
<p>There’s a logical flaw here though which is that the formula above is not a way to define the number. It presumes the
existence of a function <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span> that already exists. Indeed, if we allow ourselves to presume that <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span> is given to us, we
can write a computer program to compute that number:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb1"><pre class="sourceCode python"><code class="sourceCode python"><span id="cb1-1"><a href="#cb1-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="kw">def</span> compute_N(p):</span>
<span id="cb1-2"><a href="#cb1-2" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>  r <span class="op">=</span> <span class="dv">1</span></span>
<span id="cb1-3"><a href="#cb1-3" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>  n <span class="op">=</span> <span class="dv">0</span></span>
<span id="cb1-4"><a href="#cb1-4" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>  <span class="cf">while</span> <span class="va">True</span>:</span>
<span id="cb1-5"><a href="#cb1-5" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>    r <span class="op">*=</span> P(n)</span>
<span id="cb1-6"><a href="#cb1-6" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>    n <span class="op">+=</span> <span class="dv">1</span></span>
<span id="cb1-7"><a href="#cb1-7" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a></span>
<span id="cb1-8"><a href="#cb1-8" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>    <span class="cf">yield</span> r</span></code></pre></div>
<p>So again, there is no contradiction. The function above exists, but since we cannot provide a proper <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> is unable to be
computed. Nevertheless, it is definable in the same way we were able to do in natural language.</p>
<p>The set of all these numbers is called the <em>definable reals</em>.</p>
<h2 id="describing-whats-real">Describing what’s real</h2>
<p>So in our search for a <em>canonical</em> representation of the reals, we found that there are reals that are impossible to
ever write down, canonically or not (in fact, most reals are this way). This is not like our inability to write down
<span class="math inline">\(\sqrt{2}\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(\pi\)</span> in decimal. There exist very good algorithms for finding digits of these numbers, even starting
billions of digits in.</p>
<p>No these numbers are a wholly different thing. There are real numbers that <em>can never be written down</em> no matter what
description we choose. They defy all finite description. The digits of these numbers are, at some point, not
determinable. Being non-deterministic, they are – for lack of better word – random.</p>
<h2 id="describing-whats-not-real">Describing what’s not real</h2>
<p>If some super power from outside this universe were to choose such a number and run the universe according to its
decimal (or binary) expansion. We’d have no way of possibly knowing whether the behavior was random or very fixed. It’s
a logical impossibility.</p>
<p>Some interesting things:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Initially, the idea that there are numbers that cannot be described really bothered mathematicians. Some
mathematicians decided to ignore them completely and pretend they don’t exist. They only included reals which could
be written down using deterministic algorithms. These are called the <em>computable reals</em>. It turns out large portions
of mathematics can be re-stated in this way, but if we only include the computable reals, several properties of the
real numbers change. For example, every function on the reals becomes continuous.</li>
<li>If you haven’t noticed, these results mean it’s impossible to decide, in general, if two real numbers are equal, or
less than, or greater than.</li>
<li>The computable reals are closed under addition, multiplication, subtraction, division, etc. However, arbitrary
subsets of the computable reals may or may not have a computable upper or lower limit. Think back to the never ending
sequence for <span class="math inline">\(\sqrt{2}\)</span>. There are sets like this in the computable reals.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>In a previous post, I discussed the fact that the game of life is intractable. In general, determining if it will arrive
at particular pattern is not something anyone can ever do, period. It may have seemed that this idea of termination of a
computer program and Cantor’s argument about diagonalizing the real numbers was different. In fact, it is the same
argument.</p>
<p>In the next post, we’ll think about what this means for a topic we touched upon briefly but is fundamental to our
understanding of causation, consciousness, and reality – randomness. We’ll talk about what it means for something to be
random, and why this is linked to the nature of Turing machines / universal computation devices.</p>
