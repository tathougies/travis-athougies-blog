<div id="post">
<p>Now that I’ve finished moving, I’m once again ready to start growing. Luckily, I’m in California where we can grow almost anything regardless of the time of year. I’ve decided to take the plunge and start growing some Roma tomatoes.</p>
<p>According to the label on the pot I bought them in, these little guys should only grow to about 2 to 3 ounces in size, so they aren’t as Sun hungry as the larger varieties (like beefsteak). They’re currently on my back porch, where they get about 5 to 5.5 hours of direct sunlight each day and an additional 6 hours of bright ambient light.</p>
<p>These tomatoes are currently sitting in little pots in potting mix on my back porch. I’m hoping to grow them out until they’re big enough for me to start taking cuttings. I want to use the cuttings to run a little experiment comparing my new hydroponics system (more on that <a href="../posts/2014-08-11-new-nft-hydroponics-system.html">here</a>) to a soil-based traditional potted system to see which produces more tomatoes. More on that as it happens!</p>
<p>I took some pictures of these new additions below. As you can see, they’re currently in a makeshift greenhouse covering. Unfortunately, my back porch gets a lot of wind, so leaving these guys exposed to the wind would dry them out too quickly. These plants are especially vulnerable because I just uprooted them from their old pots and put them in new soil, so they haven’t yet had a chance to develop a vigorous root system in their new pots. Additionally, I didn’t get them in the best condition from Home Depot (some leaves were browning, and some had lesions which accelerate transpirational water loss), so they will be in this covering until they get some newer, more healthy leaves.</p>
