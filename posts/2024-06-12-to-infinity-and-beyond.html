<div id="post">
<p>Infinity is one of those concepts that sounds simple but really isn’t. It’s a concept that
simultaneously fascinates us, yet trips over even the most studious mathematician.</p>
<p>Briefly put, something is infinite if I can always find <em>one more thing</em>. For example, if I were to
look at, for example, all the cars in the United States, I could – theoretically – just go and
identify all the cars. After each, I’ll ask, “Is there another?” and eventually, there won’t be any
more. The set of all cars in America is <em>finite</em>.</p>
<p>When you think about most physical sets of things you can count, you’ll find they’re finite. Even
the number of particles in the known universe (estimated to be around around <span class="math inline">\(10^{80}\)</span>) is – again,
very theoretically – finite. You can identify all of them, if you had infinite time.</p>
<p>So what’s infinite? Well, since we’re looking at mathematics, we can just define things. Let’s
construct an infinite thing.</p>
<p>My first thing that is part of my set of infinite things I’ll just call <span class="math inline">\(Z\)</span>. Now I have a box
containing <span class="math inline">\(Z\)</span>. Excellent!</p>
<p>Okay, I need to find one more thing. Again, since mathematicians just invent stuff, we’ll call the
next thing <span class="math inline">\(SZ\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> stands for <em>successor</em>. Now if I want the next thing, I’ll just call that
<span class="math inline">\(SSZ\)</span>. Great. I have a set of infinite things. Conceptually, you can give me any thing in this
notation and if you ask me for one more, I add an <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> and give it back. Even if the number of <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span>’s
conceptually exceeds the number of known particles in the universe, I can still <em>describe</em> the next
number to you. It’s just an <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> and then <span class="math inline">\(10^{80}\)</span> more S’s and then a <span class="math inline">\(Z\)</span>.</p>
<p>That seems pretty infinite to me right? I mean, we just go on forever. There will never be a thing
in this set that I cannot stick another <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> in front of.</p>
<p>Congratulations! We have discovered our first infinite thing. And – conveniently – this thing
happens to be the natural numbers<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>.</p>
<h2 id="arithmetic-the-study-of-infinity">Arithmetic: the study of infinity</h2>
<p>Many people mistakenly believe arithmetic to be about the manipulation of numeric digits. That’s
true at one level, but if we take a step back, we can also frame it as something more
profound. Arithmetic is, fundamentally, the study of infinity. The natural numbers are the first
thing that most children encounter that is truly, tangibly infinite. Literally nothing within our
universe is infinite. Everything has bounds. Infinity exists only as an idea, and the numbers are
almost always the first infinite idea any child will have. Many children have bothered their fathers
and mothers with incessant questions as to “What’s the largest number?”. Such questions are the
foundation of future mathematical thinking.</p>
<p>Natural numbers are usually introduced along with operations. One of the most fundamental operations
kids learn is the addition of <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span>, which we all know is as follows:</p>
<p>\[x + 0 = x.\]</p>
<p>Addition is a <em>binary</em> operation. It takes two numbers and produces another. In this instance, the
equation tells us that no matter what we add to 0, we get the thing itself. Always. No
exceptions. Again, a study of infinity, because it holds for <em>all</em> numbers.</p>
<p>There is no other number for which adding it to another will always yield the other. Zero is unique,
We call it the <em>identity</em> of addition.</p>
<p>Another nice property of a binary operation is <em>the existence of inverses</em>. Consider just the
natural numbers (0, 1, 2, …). Is there any answer to the following?</p>
<p>\[2 + \square = 0\]</p>
<p>The answer is no. In the natural numbers, addition always yields something greater.</p>
<p>Luckily, again, as mathematicians, we can just make stuff up, so we can <em>complete</em> the natural
numbers by including amongst them a set of numbers noted <span class="math inline">\(-x\)</span> for any natural number <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> that, when
added to <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>, yields zero.</p>
<p>Thus, we can answer what number should be filled in <span class="math inline">\(2 + \square = 0\)</span> as <span class="math inline">\(-2\)</span>, which is a concept I just
made up, but you probably already heard about it.</p>
<p>Anyway, the natural numbers along with their additive inverses is called the integers (also referred
to as <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{Z}\)</span>).</p>
<h2 id="united-we-stand-divided-we-fall">United we stand, divided we fall</h2>
<p>The other basic arithmetic operation is multiplication, which is just repeated addition. Like
addition, multiplication also has an identity. You can prove using logic that this number is exactly
the number after zero, <span class="math inline">\(SZ\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span>. Again, going back to infinity, for every single infinite number
of <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> you can say</p>
<p>\[x \times 1 = x\]</p>
<p>That is to say, one is the <em>identity</em> of multiplication.</p>
<p>Again, we ask, do the integers contain the inverses of multiplication? That is, is there a number
such that</p>
<p>\[2 \times \square = 1?\]</p>
<p>Here, two is chosen arbitrarily, while one is the identity for multiplication.</p>
<p>Of course the answer is no, while we now have numbers (the negative ones) that, when multiplied by
a positive, will produce a number less than that number, they’ll never hit one. The integers are
<em>incomplete</em> in relation to multiplication.</p>
<p>Again, we can just make stuff up, so we can go ahead and define new numbers labeled <span class="math inline">\(\frac{1}{x}\)</span>
for all <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>, such that</p>
<p>\[x \times \frac{1}{x} = 1\]</p>
<p>Notice, however, that unlike the integers, where we only needed to add these new <span class="math inline">\(-x\)</span>s, here, we
actually have to add a whole lot more. Let’s examine.</p>
<p>Suppose I do <span class="math inline">\(2 + x\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> is a negative number. What number do I get? Well it’s just one of
the natural numbers <span class="math inline">\(0, 1, 2\)</span> <em>or</em> it’s a negative number.</p>
<p>However, for the multiplicative inverses <span class="math inline">\(\frac{1}{x}\)</span>, this does not hold.</p>
<p>For <span class="math inline">\(2 \times \frac{1}{x}\)</span>, you <em>can</em> get an integer (if <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> is one or two). However, if you do <span class="math inline">\(2 \times
\frac{1}{3}\)</span>, for example, then you get <span class="math inline">\(\frac{2}{3}\)</span> which is not an integer and not a number like
<span class="math inline">\(\frac{1}{x}\)</span>.</p>
<p>Thus, we need to add these numbers too. Because any integer <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> multiplied by <span class="math inline">\(\frac{1}{x}\)</span> is just
<span class="math inline">\(\frac{y}{x}\)</span>, more generally we have any number of the form <span class="math inline">\(\frac{y}{x}\)</span> where <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> are
integers. The process of adding in more elements in order to satisfy our initial construction is
called constructing the <em>closure</em> with respect to the multiplicative inverses <a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a>.</p>
<p>Under this system, every integer has a multiplicative inverse and these inverses themselves can also
be added and multiplied to yield other elements that are also of the same form.</p>
<p>Excellent. We’ve now formed the multiplicative completion of the integers (which are themselves the
<em>additive completion</em> of the natural numbers, which are the most elementary infinite set). These are
called the rational numbers (<span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{Q}\)</span>) because they can be written as a ratio of two other
numbers.</p>
<p>As a quick note, we have to exclude <span class="math inline">\(\frac{1}{0}\)</span> because it causes contradictions when we attempt
multiplication and addition that we don’t like <a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a>. You can include it, and some people do but you lose
some important properties that many want. Either way, the general meaning of the rationals excludes
fractions with zero underneath.</p>
<p>Note also that if <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> is negative, then you can just negate <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span>. Thus we can just say the rationals
are everything of the form <span class="math inline">\(\frac{a}{b}\)</span> where <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> is any integer and <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> is a natural number,
except 0 (so <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> is not negative).</p>
<h2 id="counting">Counting</h2>
<p>The natural numbers were just things we invented by desiring to create an infinite set. They have,
in and of themselves, no relation to the real world. We have to <em>give</em> them meaning. This is a
general property of mathematics. Mathematics is about thoughts. Someone has to make them describe
reality <a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a>.</p>
<p>Anyway, what does it mean to count? In other words, what does it mean to say there are <em>three</em> of
something?</p>
<p>Well, what happens when you ask a child to count toys in a box? The child will take out each toy,
say the next number, and then put the toy own, and then take the next toy <a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a>.</p>
<p>In other words, to say there are <em>three</em> of something, I first take the set of <span class="math inline">\(Z\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(SZ\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(SSZ\)</span>
(aka, <span class="math inline">\(0, 1, 2\)</span>), and I assign them to each of the somethings. If I can do this for all the
somethings and the labels are unique, I say that there are three of them. If there is a something
leftover or I still have labels left to assign, then I say there are not <em>three</em> of those
somethings. Pretty easy. Gosh, why do mathematicians talk so much?</p>
<p>This all makes sense for finitely many things but arithmetic is not finite. It’s the study of
infinity. So how do we count infinite things? Well, as we said, there’s no physical source of
infinite things, so we’ll just go to concepts. First, let’s count the natural numbers. It’s pretty
easy, we just have to label them. So let’s start counting. We’ll label zero with <span class="math inline">\(Z\)</span>, one with <span class="math inline">\(SZ\)</span>,
etc. How many will we have when we conceptually end? Well, it couldn’t be a number of the form
<span class="math inline">\(S...Z\)</span> (a natural). It would have to be something else, because if it were a natural, then I’d just
ask what you’d label the number <span class="math inline">\(SS...Z\)</span> and you’ll have to give me a new number! Again, since we’re
just doing theory, we just invent a notation and call it <span class="math inline">\(\infty\)</span>. We’re just making shit up at this
point.</p>
<p>Anyway, anything that can be counted using the natural numbers is called ‘countable’, because we
just like to state the obvious.</p>
<p>Notice that the natural numbers are countable, under this definition, but so are the integers. It’s
easy. I can absolutely label each integer with a natural number and never reuse them or run
out. This is easy to see. For each integer, it’s either negative (i.e. <span class="math inline">\(-x\)</span>) or positive
(i.e. <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>). If positive, then I assign the natural number <span class="math inline">\(2x\)</span>. If negative, I assign the natural
number <span class="math inline">\(2x + 1\)</span>. Zero maps to itself.</p>
<p>And vice versa, given a natural number, I can give you back every integer. It’s easy. For any
natural, if it’s even, I say that it points to half of itself. If it’s odd, I say it points to the
negation of half of its successor number. That is, two points to one since two is even and its half
is one. One points to negative one because one is odd, and half its next number (2) is one.</p>
<p>So now every integer is labeled and every natural number selects an integer. Because we can go both
ways, we find that the natural numbers are actually equal in size to the integers. A surprising
result, since intuitively there seem to be “more” integers than naturals. We think this because the
naturals are a subset of the integers, and our intuition tells us from our childhood days that if
one thing is a subset of another it must have less things. This is true of all finite sets. But
we’re talking about arithmetic, the first step to infinity.</p>
<p>The rationals are also countable, but I’m going to make you stare at a picture to understand it.</p>

<h2 id="art-is-never-finished-only-abandoned">Art is never finished, only abandoned</h2>
<p>We have now covered the concept of <em>completion</em> and <em>counting</em>. Excellent. We can do all of math now right?</p>
<p>Well, no. I have you reading this blog post so we’re just going to keep beating the horse.</p>
<p>We completed multiplication above, so that means that if we pick one number <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> and another number
<span class="math inline">\(z\)</span>, we can always find a number <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> we can multiply <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> by to get <span class="math inline">\(z\)</span>. Above, we chose two numbers
<span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(z\)</span> and found <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span>. Let’s reduce the number of choices. Let’s just pick <span class="math inline">\(z\)</span> and ask, is there
a number <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> that when multiplied by <em>itself</em> is <span class="math inline">\(z\)</span>? Well, let’s just think. If I pick <span class="math inline">\(z = 2\)</span> then
what is <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span>? Is there any number that when multiplied by itself is 2?</p>
<p>Since <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> is a rational number (by definition, since that’s what we’re thinking about), we know it
can be written as <span class="math inline">\(\frac{a}{b}\)</span> for some integer <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> and natural number <span class="math inline">\(b &gt; 0\)</span>. Now also note that
<span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> can be either positive or negative because multiplying either by itself yields a positive. This
is why your pre-algebra teacher might have writen <span class="math inline">\(\sqrt(4) = \pm 2\)</span>.</p>
<p>Anyway, we have</p>
<p>\[ \frac{a}{b} \cdot \frac{a}{b} = 2 \]</p>
<p>or</p>
<p>\[
\frac{a^2}{ b^{2}} = 2\]</p>
<p>or</p>
<p>\[ a^2 = 2b^2\]</p>
<p>Now we have that <span class="math inline">\(a^2\)</span> is an even number because it is two multiplied by another number. The product
of two odd numbers is odd, so <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> must also be even. Thus <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> is two multiplied by another number
too. Call this number <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> and we say <span class="math inline">\(a = 2m\)</span>. Now we have</p>
<p>\[(2m)^2 = 2b^2\]</p>
<p>Or</p>
<p>\[4m^2 = 2b^2\]</p>
<p>\[2m^2 = b^2\]</p>
<p>Oh wow, so <span class="math inline">\(b^2\)</span> is even too! Using the same reasoning as above, <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> is also the product of two with another number <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>. <span class="math inline">\(b = 2n\)</span>. Great, let’s substitute.</p>
<p>\[\frac{2m}{2n} \cdot \frac{2m}{2n} = 2\]</p>
<p>or</p>
<p>\[\frac{m}{n} \cdot \frac{m}{n} = 2\]</p>
<p>Did you miss it? Again… infinity.</p>
<p>We just picked two numbers that satisfied <span class="math inline">\(\frac{p}{q} \cdot \frac{p}{q} = 2\)</span> and found that
<em>actually</em> there are two smaller numbers <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> for which <span class="math inline">\(\frac{m}{n} \cdot \frac{m}{n}\)</span>
is also two. You object, saying we can always find smaller numbers. Absolutely we can… for the
rationals. But neither <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> nor <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> are rationals. They’re an integer and a non-zero natural. We
cannot always divide by two. We want infinity, but get nowhere.</p>
<p>You find that there is no least number for <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(q\)</span> that satisfy the equation. A real letdown.</p>

<p>Well notice that in math we just make things up, so surely we can make up more stuff. Let’s go!</p>
<p>Notice above that we have that <span class="math inline">\(\frac{3}{2}\)</span> multiplied by itself is <span class="math inline">\(\frac{9}{4}\)</span> which is greater
than two. And also note that <span class="math inline">\(\frac{4}{3}\)</span> multiplied by itself is <span class="math inline">\(\frac{16}{9}\)</span> which is less
than two. Thus, somewhere in there, the answer <em>must</em> exist, right?</p>
<p>Let’s just find it directly by improving our guess. We’ll start with <span class="math inline">\(\frac{3}{2}\)</span> and then, since
that’s greater than two, decrease our guess a bit. We’ll do this by computing their average.</p>
<p>Let’s start. We take <span class="math inline">\(\frac{3}{2}\)</span>. If we divide <span class="math inline">\(2\)</span> by this we get <span class="math inline">\(\frac{4}{3}\)</span>. If we had guessed
correctly we should have gotten <span class="math inline">\(\frac{3}{2}\)</span> (the same number). We didn’t so we do it again, but
this time we update our guess. Notice that <span class="math inline">\(\frac{4}{3} \cdot \frac{4}{3}\)</span> is less than 2, so the
<em>real</em> answer is somewhere in between <span class="math inline">\(\frac{3}{2}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\frac{4}{3}\)</span>. To find the number exactly
halfway, we take their average.</p>
<p>\[ \frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{3}{2} + \frac{4}{3}\right) = \frac{3}{4} + \frac{4}{6} = \frac{9}{12} +
\frac{8}{12} = \frac{17}{12}.\]</p>
<p>Repeat. We find <span class="math inline">\(2\)</span> divided by <span class="math inline">\(\frac{17}{12}\)</span> is <span class="math inline">\(\frac{24}{17}\)</span>. Notice that <span class="math inline">\(\frac{17}{12} &gt;
\frac{3}{2}\)</span> (our initial guess) and <span class="math inline">\(\frac{24}{17} &lt; \frac{4}{3}\)</span> (which was what happened when we
divided two by the initial guess). Great, we’re always going to get closer and closer to the real
answer here. Eventually, we’ll get it, right?</p>
<p>Well no… infinity. As we showed above (the proof with <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(q\)</span>), if you ever get <em>it</em>, you can
just get <em>it</em> again, but this time <em>it</em> will be better. If you collect all your guesses and their
<em>better</em> values you get an infinite set.</p>
<p>Formalized quickly, to find <span class="math inline">\(\sqrt{z}\)</span>, take a guess <span class="math inline">\(x_0\)</span> and do the following</p>
<p>\[x_{n + 1} = \frac{1}{2}\left(x_n + \frac{z}{x_n}\right)\].</p>
<p>Quickly, you can verify that for perfect squares, like four, the set of these guesses is
finite. That is, they terminate. No infinity. Which is why the square root of perfect squares is
easily written.</p>
<p>But all hope is not lost, as we saw above, we can get arbitrarily close to the <em>real</em> answer to
<span class="math inline">\(\sqrt{2}\)</span>.</p>
<p>However, the sequence for non-perfect squares will never terminate. That is to say, if our first
guess is above the real answer, there will never be a <em>least</em> answer. If there was, just do the
procedure outlined above and get a smaller number.</p>
<p>That means there are sets of the rational numbers which have no lower bound in the rational
numbers <a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a>.</p>
<p>Again, just as we had to complete the natural numbers when we found addition had no inverse, and we
had to complete the integers when we found multiplication had none, we now need to complete the
rationals by simply naming a number for each of these sets. We call these numbers the <em>reals</em>
(denoted <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{R}\)</span>). Note that in my construction above, if I want to “write” down the answer, I
can choose any <span class="math inline">\(x_{n}\)</span> after some sufficiently large <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> and say that that number is <em>close
enough</em>. If I write out the decimal expansion of these numbers, I get a close “answer” to my problem
in finite terms. But note, the decimal expansion has to be infinite because if it weren’t then the
set of ever closer answers also ought to be. Again, infinity.</p>
<p>Interestingly enough, these sorts of real numbers also have expansions that do not <em>repeat</em>. They
are <em>regular</em> in that they are predictable by computing them using the algorithm above, but they
have no repeating pattern. Because of this they’re called <em>irrational</em>.</p>
<p>As a quick note. Just as we had with the rationals where adding a few new numbers required adding
many more, we have that here too. If we add <span class="math inline">\(\sqrt{2}\)</span> as whatever monstrosity we defined above,
then we need to add <span class="math inline">\(\sqrt{2} + \sqrt{3}\)</span> as well. For the sake of not having to write a full book
on real analysis, I’m going to ignore how to think about numbers like that, but we’ll need to add
them to our set to complete addition and multiplication. More generally, the reals are all rationals
plus whatever we want to call the least number in any arbitrarily defined subset of the rationals. I
think that sounds a lot more pretentious than it is.</p>
<h1 id="counting-stars">Counting Stars</h1>
<p>So we have that the reals are the rationals plus whatever we want to call the ‘least value’ of any
arbitrary subset of the rationals. I think it’s reasonable to ask if we can label every real.</p>
<p>Since I’m not really that clever, I’m just going to assume I have a clever oracle that can tell me,
for any natural number I give it, a real number in response.</p>
<p>I’m now going to assemble these number into a table, where each row corresponds to the response I
get when asking about that row’s number. Note that there are infinitely many columns here. Also note
that we’re writing out the decimal expansion, which is fine, since the decimal expansion always
converges <a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a>. Moreover, to avoid dealing with the decimal point, the very first column
is the position of the decimal in that number. That is for ‘35.55555…’ we have <span class="math inline">\(2\)</span> in the first
column (because there are two digits before the decimal), then <span class="math inline">\(3\)</span> in the second (first digit) and
then <span class="math inline">\(5\)</span> in the remaining infinite columns.</p>
<p>Now, let’s make a new number, for the <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>th row, I’ll make the new number by taking the number in the <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>th
column and choosing something else randomly. This is illustrated below.</p>
<p>So now I have a new number whose representation in this table is given as above. This number is
another real number. I’ve told you how to compute it if you have my special oracle.</p>
<p>Does this number exist on the table?</p>
<p>Again… infinity. The answer is a resounding no. If the number did exist at row <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> then the digit
at column <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> would have to be different from the entry in thet able in row <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> (by
construction). Thus it cannot occupy any row <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>.</p>

<h2 id="its-aleph">It’s Aleph!</h2>
<p>Don’t worry we can always make up new shit. Remember, this is math.</p>
<p>Mathematicians call the size of things like the natural numbers numbers <span class="math inline">\(\aleph_0\)</span>. That funny N thing is the
Hebrew letter Aleph. It is pronounced “Aleph-null”.</p>
<p>The size of the real numbers is <span class="math inline">\(2^{\aleph_0}\)</span>. As an exercise to the reader: consider why this is
true. First, take a finite set like <span class="math inline">\({0, 1, 2}\)</span>. How many ways are there to form subsets of this set
with 3 elements? Then, how many ways are there to form subsets of a set with <span class="math inline">\(\aleph_0\)</span> elements?.</p>
<p>Some more topics of interest.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>There are infinities larger than <span class="math inline">\(\aleph_0\)</span>! <span class="math inline">\(\aleph_1\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\aleph_2\)</span>, etc</p></li>
<li><p>You can make <span class="math inline">\(2^{\aleph_0}\)</span> equivalent to <span class="math inline">\(\aleph_1\)</span>. That is you can just assume that and math
works. However, there’s no way of “knowing” whether or not this is true. If you believe, it’s
taken axiomatically. It’s not possible to prove it.</p></li>
<li><p>You can also assume that <span class="math inline">\(2^{\aleph_0}\)</span> is not equal to <span class="math inline">\(\aleph_1\)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p>That is to say, there are valid proofs using valid logic that the size of the reals is <span class="math inline">\(\aleph_1\)</span>
and that the size of the reals is not <span class="math inline">\(\aleph_1\)</span>. What this means is left up to the reader. This
is called the continuum hypothesis. Hopefully this doesn’t lead you to question the very
foundation of mathematics and infinity.</p></li>
<li><p>The set of all infinities of this sort are called the ‘cardinal’ numbers:</p>
<p>\[\{0,1,2,\ldots,\aleph_0, \aleph_1, \ldots\}\]</p>
<p>This is a ‘transfinite’ set because it includes infinity.</p></li>
<li><p>You can do most of math on the cardinal numbers. That is, you can multiply, add, subtract,
exponentiate various infinities.</p></li>
<li><p>You can go beyond this. If you take the set of all <span class="math inline">\(\aleph\)</span> numbers and ask what’s the largest of
these you have to invent an even larger infinity <span class="math inline">\(\aleph_\omega\)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p>There are uncountably many infinities.</p></li>
</ol>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Hopefully, this post convinced you that infinity is a lot more complicated than it seemed. While it
may seem very easy to come up with an infinite set, the moment we try to think about it in very
reasonable ways, we end up with very complicated objects.</p>
<p>This field of counting things is called “discrete mathematics”, and is unfortunately completely
ignored by most high school level mathematics courses. It’s unfortunate because it ultimately puts
forth several very important questions about the nature of knowledge itself.</p>
<p>In following posts, we’re going to talk about why computation as an abstract principle is innately
tied to our knowledge of the real numbers, and knowledge in general.</p>

<li id="fn3"><p>To delve deeper, this is because multiplication <em>distributes</em> over addition and

identity over addition). This holds true for <em>any</em> operation that acts like multiplication, not
just multiplication of natural numbers. “Multiplication” by the additive inverse must yield the
