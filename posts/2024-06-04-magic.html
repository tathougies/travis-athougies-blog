<p>If asked to recall famous physicists, most people will name Newton and Einstein. Some may mention
Feynman or Curie or Hawking. Relatively few will mention Maxwell, even though the equations he came
up with are perhaps the most remarkable.</p>
<p>For background, Maxwell provided us four relatively simple differential equations (listed below)
that describe the behavior of light. What’s remarkable about these equations is that they are
correct. It’s a great tragedy of history that Newton is so well known for his laws of motion (that
are actually wrong), while Maxwell is not known for his laws of electromagnetism, which have been
subject to endless scrutiny and have proven extremely accurate.</p>

<div class="figure figure-centered"><a href="../images/magic/maxwell-equations.png"><img src="../images/magic/maxwell-equations.png" alt="Maxwell’s equations" style="max-width: 300px"></a><p class="caption">Maxwell’s equations</p></div>
<figcaption>Maxwell’s equations</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>We have very good simulations of these equations. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxwell's_equations">Maxwell’s
equations</a> can be used to simulate radio wave
propagation, semiconductor behavior, magnetism, and the stars. They are widely applicable and, while
adjustments have been made to them in order to better capture our modern understanding of the
universe’s geometry, the fundamental statement of the equations has been found to be correct.</p>
<p>So it’s very unfortunate then that his equations are also wrong.</p>
<p>They’re wrong not because they aren’t right, but because they don’t characterize that which they
describe.</p>
<p>Here’s a thought experiment, when we simulate a radio wave or a semiconductor, is that the same
thing as the real thing? Even if we get our simuation perfect, so that it is at 100% fidelity, we
can still distinguish between the simulation which is only portaying what reality could be, and
reality itself. Put another way, if I simulate a magnet on a computer, and hold a compass near by,
will the compass move?</p>
<p>So in the sense that Maxwell’s equations only describe the electromagnetic force, rather than tell
us what the force <em>is</em>, the equations are incorrect. A description of something is not a statement
on its nature.</p>
<p>In fact, we know very little about the electromagnetic force in terms of what it actually <em>is</em>. Most
physicists today have adopted the “shut-up-and-calculate” approach, due to how seemingly intractable
it is to use empirical measurements to get at the underlying reality of the universe. Again, I don’t
want to diminish these efforts. They are truly remarkable, and extremely useful for the problems
humans have to solve. But, for now, inquiries into the nature of reality may have to break from
them.</p>
<h1 id="magic-math">Magic math</h1>
<p>There’s a view in artificial intelligence that I call the “Magic Math” hypothesis. Proponents of
this hypothesis, of which there are many, purport that by creating a mathematical description of
intelligence and then optimizing it to behave in a way resembling humans necessarily gives rise to
the same sort of internal experience or consciousness that characterizes humans. They point out that
we ourselves only have evidence for our own internal experience, and rely on observation alone to
note it in others. They are not totally wrong. Again, like Maxwell, we are forced to deal with only
a description of other’s experiences, rather than their fundamental nature. They point out then,
that we have no reason to believe that the AI systems being created today don’t similarly have an
inner experience of some sort, because we can observe the same descriptive attributes on them that
we observe in others.</p>
<p>In other words, since they’ve gotten the math correct, and the math accurately describes reality and
is being calculated so that it seems like it’s reality, then that’s enough.</p>
<p>To me this argument is not compelling. As we’ve already established, even a 100% faithful simulation
of something is not the same thing as the thing itself.</p>
<p>Thus, their reasoning for their claim ought to be rejected and the status of their claim (that AI
does have a kind of inner experience) is back at something that has no real proof either way.</p>
<h1 id="magic-mushrooms">Magic mushrooms</h1>
<p>A last resort treatment for epilepsy is called a <em>Corpus callosotomy</em>. In this procedure the corpus
callosum, the bundle of nerves connecting the left and right portions of the brain are severed. One
of the results of this is that the two hemispheres (left and right) have trouble communicating with
one another.</p>
<p>A result of this in some patients is that one side of their body (usually the left) takes on a mind
of its own. This is called ‘callosal syndrome’. In one case, a patient who had undergone this
procedure would have two sides of his body in conflict
<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Split-brain">Wikipedia</a> recounts the story of a man
whose one side was violently beating his wife while the other side rushed to save her. Were both
‘sides’ aware?</p>
<p>In the same way that a callostomy reduces the experience of consciousness, psychedelic drugs have
been claimed to <em>expand</em> it. For example, many who have taken magic mushrooms claim that it has
<em>expanded</em> their sensation of consciousness and given them access to feelings <em>beyond</em> their
body. Again, this furthers the materialist (or partial materialist) view that consciousness ‘runs’
on material reality. If drugs in our mind can turn consciousness on, or amplify the way it feels,
then there must be something physical going on that we can describe somehow.</p>
<p>One of the omnipresent concepts in quantum physics is that of a field. Many things are
fields. You’ve probably heard about the electromagnetic one. There are others – gravity, the
‘color’/strong force, etc. Particles also have fields. So there’s an electron field, a proton field,
etc.</p>
<p>In general, a field is nothing more than a function <span class="math inline">\(F: \vec{X} \rightarrow D\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(\vec{X}\)</span> is
some location in space-time and <span class="math inline">\(D\)</span> is some measurement. For example, the electric field <span class="math inline">\(q: \vec{X};
\rightarrow Q\)</span> maps each location in the universe to the charge present at that location. There’s
also the electromagnetic force field, <span class="math inline">\(V: \vec{X} \rightarrow \vec{V}\)</span> which maps to each point in
space the electromagnetic field potential present there (relative to some other point – usually
expressed as voltage).</p>
<p>In the same way there’s a field for all of these, there’s also a field for unicorns, elephants, and
rainbows <a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a>. Again, we have to be careful to avoidd the mistake of confusing the description of a thing
with the thing itself. A field is just a mapping. If we can make the statement “There’s an elephant
there” (even if only conceptually), we can model it as a field. It’s just as real as the other
fields. It’s just a description of reality.</p>
<p>Of course, fields can <em>depend</em> on one another. The magnetic field is intrinsically linked to the
electric field. That is to say, it’s a <em>function</em> of the electric field. In other words, if you know
the electric field, you can determine the magnetic field.</p>
<p>\[\vec{B} = f(\vec{E})\]</p>
<p>This relation and its inverse are used to transmit electricity and radio stations. Moreover, the
fields are related to matter (the arrangement of electrons mostly).</p>
<p>\[\vec{E} = f(e^{-})\]</p>
<p>In fact, we cannot manipulate the electrical field directly. We do it by moving matter. One only
need to visit a power generating station to see how we use matter to manipulate these fields on a
grand scale. Being unable to interact with a field directly does not make it less real.</p>
<p>So going back to ‘reality’, whatever it is, consciousness is just as ‘real’ as anything else. We
have tools to manipulate it by manipulating the other fields that we can directly observe and move.</p>
<p>In this interpretation, consciousness is now <em>at least</em> function of material reality (all those
particle fields, force fields, etc). Perhaps it’s also a function of some hitherto unknown
field. Either way, it’s all just as ‘real.’</p>
<h1 id="magic-monkeys">Magic monkeys</h1>
<p>Futurist and science-fiction writer Arther C Clarke said that any sufficiently advanced technology
is indistinguishable from magic. Indeed the language models we have today would seem like witchcraft
to any previous civilization, yet they’re just a basic application of the idea of matrices, which
are first known to have arisen in the Chinese Text “九章算术” (The Nine Chapters of Mathematical
Art).</p>
<p>Knowing that consciousness is partly material still does not really help us because we haven’t shown
that it’s totally so. We know that we can take non-zero values of the consciousness field and affect
them, increasing or decreasing them (apparently), but the only way we know to make it go from zero
to anything else is by making a new human (another materially-involed process). If there’s more to
it, a non-materialist could be justified by saying we have no material means to make it take these
large leaps.</p>
<p>But since we don’t really understand how any of it works, I think it’s safe to say that, by our
current understanding, humans (and some mushrooms?) are magic, but their mathematical descriptions
are not.</p>
